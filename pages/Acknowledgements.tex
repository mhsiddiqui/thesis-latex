%Computational modeling is branch of computer science which deals with multiple disciplines. It assists other domains in understanding complex systems and phenomena by providing theory, tools and technology to model and simulate related systems and phenomena. In complex systems, behavior of an individual can have butterfly effect and can become root cause of an emergent phenomenon. Interaction of drivers with each other and surrounding environment forms the dynamics of traffic flow. Hence global effects of a traffic flow depend upon behavior of a single driver. In this research.
