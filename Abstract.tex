Text to speech synthesis system is system which takes raw text as input and converts it into speech signal.
This is done by concatenation of small speech segments called phonetic strings of words or 
Statistical parametric speech synthesis which uses parameters to describe speech. In
this technique, model is learned from speech data using Hidden Markov model (HMM) or Deep Neural Networks (DNN).

This paper describes development of Festival TTS system based Urdu text to speech system using Hidden Markov model (HMM). It describes Urdu text preprocessor 
system used to process numbers, dates and time text in input data and how Festvox voice package is generated for Urdu. In the end, evaluation of 
system is conducted using DRT, MRT and MOS tests to get performance of the system.
