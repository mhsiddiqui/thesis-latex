Text to speech synthesis system is system which takes raw text as input and converts it into speech signal.
This is done by concatenation of small speech segments called phonetic strings of words. The purpose of
this system is to help people who cannot read because of illiteracy or some other problem like blindness.
Statistical parametric speech synthesis is another approach which uses parameters to describe speech. In
this technique, model is learned from speech data. Conventional Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis systems
are mostly based on Hidden Markov model (HMM). HMM based system has some limitations as it cannot
model complicated context dependencies. There are other techniques like Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
which can cover limitations in HMM based system and can also outperform HMM based system.
Our goal is to extend word that has already been done in speech synthesis for Urdu and work on
alternative and better approach other than HMM like Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and better text
processing techniques in order to improve intelligibility of the synthesized speech. \\ \\
